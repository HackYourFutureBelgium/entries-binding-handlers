# Entries: Binding Handlers

A starter-project for group study.  _Most_ of the code in this repository is already written, and all the code that is written works.  Your task is to complete the missing code described in [Tasks](#tasks).

Choose one member of your team to be repository owner, they will fork this repo. The rest of your team mates will fork from their fork and submit changes via Pull Request.  Divide the tasks among your team members and get coding!

Looking for a bonus?  Set up a project board in the main group repository and track your team's progress using issues.

## Learning Objectives

* Binding methods for use as event handlers
* Contributing to an existing code base
* Writing test cases
* Collaborative Development
